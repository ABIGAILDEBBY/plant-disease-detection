#### Project Overview
This project leverages a Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate a CNN model for classifying crop diseases in images. The model is trained on the Plant Disease Recognition Dataset from Kaggle.

#### Installation

The project requires the following Python libraries:
<ul>
<li>tensorflow</li>
<li>keras</li>
</ul>
To install these dependencies, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command:

`pip install tensorflow keras`

#### Data Preparation

##### Dataset Download:

Download the Plant Disease Recognition Dataset from Kaggle. You will likely need a Kaggle account to access the data.
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The Jupyter Notebook includes code for loading the downloaded dataset, performing necessary preprocessing steps (e.g., resizing, normalization), and splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
Model Training and Evaluation (Jupyter Notebook)

The Jupyter Notebook serves as the primary development environment for this project. It will contain the following functionalities:

<ul>
<li>Model Definition: The notebook will define the CNN architecture using Keras, specifying layers like convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers. You can customize the model architecture within the notebook.<li>
<li>Model Compilation: The notebook will compile the model, defining an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) suitable for multi-class classification. <li>
<li>Model Training: The notebook will train the model on the prepared training data, potentially using the validation set to monitor performance and prevent overfitting. Training progress might be visualized using techniques like loss curves and accuracy curves. </li>
<li>Model Evaluation: Once trained, the notebook will evaluate the model's performance on the unseen testing set, calculating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each disease class.</li>
</ul>


#### Additional Notes

This is a foundational example of a CNN for crop disease detection. Consider exploring more complex architectures and hyperparameter tuning for potentially better performance.
Data augmentation techniques can be implemented within the notebook to artificially increase the size and diversity of your training data.
Transfer learning using pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet50 is a possible approach for feature extraction, potentially improving performance with less training data.

#### Getting Started

Download the Plant Disease Recognition Dataset.
Open the provided Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., JupyterLab, Google Colab).
Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
